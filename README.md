# XML and JSON Analyzer
I was given a project in which it was specified that I build various programs designed to handle XML and JSON data structures and properly navigate them. There are two primary features outlined in this project. The first was to have a XML and a XML schema data structure as inputs and for the program to verify if they contained the same information and were compatible with one another. The second and more important feature was to design a Xpath fucntion to navigate the nested nature of XML files. Given a XML file we would then need to store it and navigate it using a webpage GUI. In the GUI you would enter an Xpath or file path (ex. /Hotels/Names/) and the program would print all the nested information under the given path.
